tweddit.pw
==========
Pure HTML+JS based, this html aims to bring a similar twitter-like interface to reddit (that's why that name).

If you open the main page you'll get a list of the latest Reddit posts, and if you leave the page open this will check every 30secs for new posts in reddit, and add a small message on top to let you know there are more sites to see.

Similar to having twitter open and getting the notices about new tweets available for you.
